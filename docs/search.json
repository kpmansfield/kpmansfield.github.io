Sawyer’s Prelude to Mathematics (dating from 1955) concerning ‘unification’ in mathematics:\n\n…hundreds of papers are written, each clarifying one facet of the truth; the subject is growing. … It then ceases to be necessary to read the hundreds of separate contributions… The variegated results are welded together into a single doctrine… The new methods having become common property, new problems are found which they are insufficient to solve…new papers are published; expansion begins again. There always is, there always will be something to learn, something to conquer.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{mansfield2012,\n  author = {Mansfield, Kevin},\n  title = {Unification in {Mathematics}},\n  date = {2012-03-07},\n  url = {https://kpmansfield.github.io/posts/2025-05-26/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nMansfield, Kevin. 2012. “Unification in Mathematics.” March\n7, 2012. https://kpmansfield.github.io/posts/2025-05-26/."

My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."
