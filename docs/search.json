My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the Sep/Oct issue of the SLL Newsletter, Peter Boyce has suggested\n\nthat the lighting industry should identify its top 10 questions, to be addressed by research within the next decade, and set out a commitment to funding what it takes to get the answers. This could help researchers and educators of lighting to stay focused on the important issues…\n\nThis chimes in very nicely with the famous essay by Richard Hamming—You and Your Research—where he states that great scientists “have something between 10 and 20 important problems for which they are looking for an attack”. The key word here is attack—there needs to be a possible approach, a line of thrust, a push to overcome an important problem. He continues:\n\nIf you do not work on an important problem, it’s unlikely you’ll do important work.\n\nSo what are the important problems in lighting research? And significantly, what is a possible line of attack?\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{mansfield2027,\n  author = {Mansfield, Kevin},\n  title = {Lighting {Research} {Questions}},\n  date = {2027-02-05},\n  url = {https://kpmansfield.github.io/posts/2025-05-26-my-blog-post/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nMansfield, Kevin. 2027. “Lighting Research Questions.”\nFebruary 5, 2027. https://kpmansfield.github.io/posts/2025-05-26-my-blog-post/."
