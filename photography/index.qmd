title: "Photography"
---

As a wizard and scholar of Middle-earth, I have been studying the magic of the natural world for centuries. Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.
